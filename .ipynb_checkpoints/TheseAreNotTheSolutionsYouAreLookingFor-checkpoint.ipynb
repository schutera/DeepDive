Would you say that you know what Marvin learned or what exactly he is capable of in the end? I do not want to spoil it for you, but in real life the hard task begins right after training a model - propper validation is key. Especially in safety critical systems. And there are enough [incidents](https://incidentdatabase.ai/) to demonstrate how models can fail and why it is so hard to prevent these failures.\n",

    "Usually, visualizations to building your intuition are most beneficial during your first training runs on problems you do not know what to expect from your neural network. In visualizations, you might also be able to pick up wrong label assignments (think somebody labeled all \"8\"s as \"9\"s), ambiguous or overlapping classes (think somebody labeled all \"6\"s and \"9\"s as the same class). These things do not usually happen in beautifully cleaned datasets such as MNIST. But I promise you, you will be surprised how messy these public datasets out there are. And further, I promise you that if you are building your own datasets, these bugs will be there too and want to be found.\n",

    "[From beginning to mastery](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Andrej Karpathy Abstract: Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications is a visual recognition task such as image classification, localization, and detection. Recent developments in neural networks (aka “deep learning”) have significantly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures focusing on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train, and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). We will focus on teaching how to set up image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g., backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks, and guide the students through hands-on assignments and a final course project. Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the ImageNet Challenge.
